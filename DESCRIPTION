Title: Pipe-Friendly Vector Replacement with Case Statements
Version: 0.2.1.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Alexander",
           family = "Rossell Hayes",
           role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"),

Description: Offers a pipe-friendly alternative to the 'dplyr'
    functions case_when() and if_else().  These functions accept a vector
    as an optional first argument, allowing conditional statements to be
    built using the 'magrittr' dot operator.  The functions also coerce
    all possible outputs to the same type, meaning you no longer have to
    worry about using specific typed variants of NA or explicitly
    declaring integer outputs.
