Description: Offers a pipe-friendly alternative to the 'dplyr' functions
    case_when() and if_else().  These functions accept a vector as an
    optional first argument, allowing conditional statements to be built
    using the 'magrittr' dot operator.  The functions also coerce all
    possible outputs to the same type, meaning you no longer have to worry
    about using specific typed variants of NA or explicitly declaring
    integer outputs.
